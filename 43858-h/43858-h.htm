<p><span class="smcap">Descr.</span> Shrub from two to three feet or more in height, the
thickest part of the stem not exceeding the size of the little
finger, covered with a smooth brown bark, irregularly branched;
Flowers appearing before the leaves are fully expanded, and
produced in umbels at the extremities of the branches, from
eight to twelve or more in an umbel, of a fine yellow colour
and agreeable fragrance; each blossom is about the size of that
of the horse-chestnut, and as some of them are produced much
earlier than others, the plant of course continues a considerable
time in bloom, standing on short peduncles; Calyx very
short, viscous, and irregularly divided, most commonly into
five ovato-lanceolate segments; Corolla, tube cylindrical, viscous,
grooved, brim divided into five segments, undulated and
somewhat wrinkled, ovate, pointed, three turning upwards,
two downwards, of the three uppermost segments the middle
one more intensely yellow than the others and inclining to
orange, with which it is sometimes spotted; Stamina usually
five, yellow, projecting beyond the corolla, and turning upwards
near their extremities; Antheræ orange-coloured; Pollen
whitish and thready; Germen somewhat conical, evidently
hairy, and somewhat angular; Style yellowish, filiform, projecting
beyond the stamina, and turning upwards; Stigma
forming a round green head.</p>

<p>The figure and description here given were taken from a plant which
flowered by means of artificial heat, in the spring of 1798, at Mr.
<span class="smcap">Watson's</span>, Nurseryman, Islington, and which had been introduced
the same year, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Hove</span>, of Warsaw.</p>

<p>As an hardy ornamental shrub, it bids fair to prove an acquisition truly
valuable, its flowers produced in the months of June and July, being
highly ornamental as well as fragrant.</p>

<p>We have the best authority for regarding this plant as the <i>Chamærhodendros
Pontica</i> of <span class="smcap">Tournefort</span>, it agrees with his own specimens
in Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks's</span> Herbarium, it accords also with his description,
and figures, more especially of those flowers which are of their
natural size; nor have we any doubts of its being the <i>Azalea Pontica</i> of
Prof. <span class="smcap">Pallas</span>, figured in the <i>Flor. Rossica</i>, since it corresponds generally
with his description, though not in all points with his figure, which
bears evident marks of inaccuracy, the stigma, for instance, is represented
as trifid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tournefort</span> found this plant on the eastern side of the Black Sea,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hove</span> on the north side near Oczakow, and elsewhere; Professor
<span class="smcap">Pallas</span> on Mount Caucasus.</p>

<p>As yet there has been no opportunity of ascertaining the best means of
propagating this new denizen, but there is every reason to suppose that
it will succeed with the treatment bestowed on the other <i>Azalea's</i>.</p>

<p>Prof. <span class="smcap">Pallas</span> relates that the honey of bees frequenting the flowers
of this plant is supposed to be narcotic, and that goats, kine, and
sheep on eating its leaves have been poisoned thereby.</p>

<p>By permission and with the approbation of Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Hove</span>,
the following extracts from his journal are here inserted.</p>

<p>"June 9, 1796, found a few of this species of <i>Azalea</i> on the river
Dnieper in swampy ground, four feet high, beginning to blow,
called here the stupifying shrub, and considered by some as highly
efficacious in curing the venereal disease.</p>

<p>"June 20, found this species on the river Dniester, on the estate of
Count <span class="smcap">Stanislaus Sczesny Potocki</span>, about sixteen English
miles from the town of Mohilow, in peat earth, from four to twenty
feet high; regarded by the common people as intoxicating, and
used in the cure of various diseases.</p>

<p>"July 4, near Oczakow, found thousands of these plants fully
blown, in a marsh, every spring-tide overflown by the sea; found
there also, a Tartarian farmer, who lived entirely by the profits
arising from the honey which the bees extracted from the flowers
of this plant, sold to Constantinople and other parts of Turkey for
medicinal uses.</p>

<p>"July 15, arrived at Trebizond, found a valley about ten English
miles from the sea covered with these plants."</p>

<p>On cultivation, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hove</span> relates that he found the <i>Azalea's</i> from
Trebizond much more tender than those from the borders of the
Dnieper and the Dniester, and was therefore inclined to regard them
as strong varieties if not distinct species.</p>

<p>The leaves, when fully expanded, are in size and figure like those
on the plate, hairy on both sides, and terminating in a very remarkable
blunt mucro or point, which has not been noticed either by those who
have described or figured the plant as it deserves, for it appears to
form a very strong character.</p>

<p>The present is one of those plants which is entitled to our
admiration, for its curious and singular structure, rather than
for any extraordinary figure it makes in a collection; not that
its flowers are without a certain share of beauty.</p>

<p>It is an annual, growing to about the height of two feet;
the whole plant is viscous, and, if bruised, smells somewhat disagreeably;
the flowers do not open at any particular time as
those of the <i>Mirabilis</i> do, and each contains only three stamina;
when they fall off, which they do soon after expanding, the
calyx closes on the germen, enlarges, droops, and becomes
deeply plaited; on the ripening of the seed it turns brown,
expands, and is suspended like a little umbrella over the seed,
which when perfectly ripe drops out on the ground; the expanded
calyx in this state appears somewhat like the flower of
a Physalis.</p>

<p>This plant flowers from June to October, and ripens its
seeds in the open air; it is not difficult of culture, requires the
same treatment as other tender annuals from Peru.</p>

<p>Our figure was drawn from a plant which flowered 1796,
in the collection of the Marchioness of <span class="smcap">Bute</span>, and was raised
from Peruvian seeds, sent her by Prof. <span class="smcap">Ortega</span> of Madrid,
under the name of <i>Mirabilis triandra</i>; Mons. <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span>
has figured and described it as the <i>Mirabilis viscosa</i>; Mons.
<span class="smcap">L'Heritier</span>, from a consideration of all its characters, has
been induced to make a new genus of it, which he has called
<i>Oxybaphus</i>.</p>

<p>In the 6th vol. of the <i>Amœnitates Academicæ</i>, <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>
describes this species of <i>Gnaphalium</i>, most probably from dried
specimens collected at the Cape, where it is a native; so insignificant
did the plant appear to him, that in his description,
he calls it <i>misera</i>; compared with the more magnificent species,
such a term might not perhaps be inapplicable: but, though
small, the plant possesses much beauty when cultivated, and
hence is generally kept in our green-houses.</p>

<p>It flowers from March to August.</p>

<p>Its branches, naturally weak and trailing, require to be
carefully tied up; if this business be executed with taste and
judgment, the natural beauty of the plant may be considerably
heightened.</p>

<p>It is readily increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>Was introduced to the royal garden at Kew, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>,
in 1774.</p>

<p>Though not so shewy a plant as many of the genus, we find
this species of <i>Hibiscus</i> in most collections of green-house
plants about London, flowering from June to September.</p>

<p>Its foliage is singular, its blossoms sulphur coloured with a
tint of orange on the under side and without scent; if suffered
to grow, this shrub will acquire a considerable height; it seeds
freely, by which the plant is readily increased, and by these it
requires to be renewed once in two or three years.</p>

<p>Is a native of the Cape, from whence it was introduced, by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774. <i>Ait. Kew.</i></p>

<p>It will be seen by the synonyms, that authors have been
divided in their opinions as to the genus of this plant; <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>
the younger, in his <i>Suppl.</i> makes it an <i>Hibiscus</i>; <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span>,
a <i>Pavonia</i>; <span class="smcap">L'Heritier</span>, an <i>Urena</i>; Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>,
an <i>Hibiscus</i>; not partial to the multiplying of genera, unless
there be an obvious necessity for it, we have in the present
instance followed the first and last of these writers.</p>

<p>As a shrub commonly cultivated for ornament in our gardens
and plantations, the <i>Hydrangea arborescens</i> has a right to appear
in this work, nevertheless it is more with a view to illustrate
a peculiar character of the genus that it is here figured.</p>

<p>This shrub is a native of Virginia, and was introduced in
1736, by <span class="smcap">P. Collinson</span>, Esq. it is of low growth, rarely
exceeding four feet in height; its flowers are produced on the
summits of the branches, somewhat in the manner of the <i>Laurustinus</i>;
they are small, crowded, nearly white, with a tinge
of red in them which is not very brilliant, and some fragrance;
they are produced in July and August, and sometimes followed
by ripe seeds here.</p>

<p>Is easily propagated by parting its roots the latter end of
October, prefers a moist soil, but will grow in a dry one; if
in severe frosts the stalks, which are rather soft, should be
killed, new ones will be put up the following Spring.</p>

<p>It appears to be a point not yet fully determined, whether the
present plant exhibits the appearances belonging to it in a state
of nature, or those which are in a certain degree the effect of
accident, or of art; in its fructification it certainly is not so
completely barren as the Guilder Rose, <i>Viburnum Opulus</i>, cultivated
in our gardens, since it has most of its parts perfect;
yet as none of the authors who have seen it in China or Japan
(where it is said not only to be much cultivated but indigenous<a name="plate_FNanchor_1_1" id="plate_FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>)
describe its fruit, we are inclined on that account to regard it,
in a certain degree, as monstrous.</p>

<p>It will appear by the synonyms, that authors have entertained
very different opinions as to what this plant really is; <span class="smcap">Jussieu</span>
following <span class="smcap">Commerson</span> makes it an <i>Hortensia</i>, <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span> a
<i>Viburnum</i>, <span class="smcap">Loureiro</span>, ridiculously enough, a <i>Primula</i>, and
Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> an <i>Hydrangea</i>.</p>

<p>In the original description of the characters of the genus
<i>Hydrangea</i> by <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>, there is no mention made of two
different kinds of florets, as in the <i>Viburnum</i>, nor has any author
that I am acquainted with described the <i>Hydrangea arbor.</i>
as producing such; yet, to my great surprise, in a plant of
this sort which flowered in my garden at Brompton in July
1797, three of the Cymæ, and three only, threw out each of
them from their circumference a very different flower from
those in the centre, smaller indeed, but very similar to the
flowers of the <i>Hydrang. hort.</i> see Pl. 437. In 1788, Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter</span>
published his <i>Fl. Carolin.</i> in which he describes a second species
of <i>Hydrangea</i>, which he calls <i>radiata</i>,<a name="plate_FNanchor_2_2" id="plate_FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> having very distinctly,
as in the <i>Viburnum</i>, two different kinds of florets in
the same Cyma, this variation in the florets is added by him to
the generic character: the similarity which exists between the
flowers of Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter's</span> <i>Hydrangea radiata</i>, and those of the
present plant sufficiently justify Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span> in making it an
<i>Hydrangea</i>; the appearances observed by <span class="smcap">Loureiro</span><a name="plate_FNanchor_3_3" id="plate_FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> on dissecting
the germen, and our discovery of the existence of two
different kinds of flowers in the <i>Hydrangea arborescens</i>, tend
still more to confirm its propriety; we may add, that in the very
habit of these several plants there exists a considerable similarity;
still, however, it is only by ripe seed-vessels of the present plant,
that this doubtful matter can be satisfactorily cleared up; but it
will not follow, that if it be not an <i>Hydrangea</i> it must be a
<i>Viburnum</i>.</p>

<p>This magnificent and highly ornamental plant, according
to Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, was introduced from China to the royal
garden at Kew, by Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span>, Bart. in 1790; it
was imported by Mr. <span class="smcap">Slater</span> about the same time, with whom
it is said to have first flowered in this country.</p>

<p>If room were allowed us, it would be superfluous to describe
minutely a plant now so very common; suffice it to
say, that from a strong perennial root, rise a number of half-shrubby,
irregular, somewhat spongy stalks, strongly spotted
when young with purple, from one to three feet high, terminated
by large bunches of flowers, at first green, then rose-coloured,
and finally green a second time; these are the most
common changes to which they are liable: but it will sometimes
happen that a plant which has produced red flowers
one year, shall produce blue another, though growing in the
same pot; this we saw happen in the year 1796 to a plant in
the possession of the Countess of <span class="smcap">Upper Ossory</span>, whose refined
taste and superior judgment have in several instances
contributed to render our works more acceptable to the
public: the coloured changeable part of the flower is regarded
as the calyx, in the centre of which is the corolla,
containing the stamina, &amp;c. all varying greatly in point of
number; besides these, there are other flowers without any
calyx, but the parts which they contain do not seem to be
more perfect than those of the others, nor more productive
of ripe fruit.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of this plant, trials have been made
in regard to its hardiness, and it is found to survive mild winters
if planted in very warm sheltered situations; but in others,
both stalks and leaves are liable to be killed by slight frosts,
though the roots are not; if persons are anxious to have it
in the open border, the best mode will be to cut down the
stems at the approach of winter, and cover over the root
with rotten tan, or some light substance; in the spring fresh
stalks will shoot forth, but it is more common to keep this
plant during winter in a green-house or well secured frame;
by artificial heat it may be brought to flower in April or
May, without such, it begins to blossom about June, and continues
in bloom till October; when successfully treated, it
will acquire the height of three feet, and produce bunches
of flowers supremely magnificent: such plants in pots are admirably
adapted for decorating court-yards, balconies, &amp;c.
unless carefully cut in, it is apt to grow too large for the
green-house, therefore it is proper to have a succession of
young plants from cuttings, which strike very freely; this
plant loves water, is indeed almost an aquatic, a rich soil, and
plenty of pot room.</p>

<p>Of the genus <i>Illicium</i> there are at present only two known
species, viz. the <i>anisatum</i> and <i>floridanum</i>, the former a native
of China and Japan, the latter of Florida; both of them are
cultivated in this country, but the latter more generally, on
account of the superior beauty of its flowers, which are of a
fine deep red colour, and have the appearance of being double,
though the petals are not preternaturally multiplied; when the
plant is in bloom the peduncles hang down, when the petals
drop they become erect; the blossoms are not distinguished
by their fragrance, though the seed-vessels, and seeds (which
do not come to perfection with us) are said to be strongly
odoriferous; the foliage of this plant is also much admired:
taking it indeed altogether, there are few shrubs held in higher
estimation.</p>

<p>According to Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, this species was introduced by
<span class="smcap">John Ellis</span>, Esq. in 1776; but <span class="smcap">Isaac Walker</span>, Esq. of
Southgate, was the first who possessed it in this country, he
informs me by letter, that he received plants of it from Pensacola
in 1771, by the hands of Mr. <span class="smcap">John Bradley</span>, and that
he communicated some of them to Dr. <span class="smcap">Fothergill</span>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Pitcairn</span>,
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>. It flowers from April to July.</p>

<p>Cultivators differ widely as to their treatment of this plant,
some keeping it in the stove, others in the green-house, while
some have ventured to plant it in the open ground in warm
situations; it probably is more hardy than we imagine; all
agree in propagating it by layers, or by seeds if they can be
procured. <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>, contrary to his usual practice, distinguishes
the two species by their colour only, and <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span>
is disposed to regard them as mere varieties.</p>

<p>The flowers of this plant so strongly resemble those of the
Campanula, that it is no wonder the older Botanists regarded it
as such, <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> himself did so at first, and <span class="smcap">Miller</span> also; and
even now it may perhaps be doubted whether it ought to be made
a distinct genus of, since it is found to differ principally in the
number of its parts of fructification.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Canary Islands, whence its name, was
cultivated in the royal garden, Hampton-Court, as long since
as the year 1696<a name="plate_FNanchor_4_4" id="plate_FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, and is a tender herbaceous plant, to be found
in most of our greenhouses; its stem rises to the height of six or
more feet, its flowers produced singly from the fork of the stalk
are large and shewy, they begin to open at the commencement
of winter, and continue to blow till March.</p>

<p>"Is propagated by parting of its roots, which must be done
with caution; for, as the root is fleshy, if they are broken or
wounded, the milky juice will flow out plentifully; so that
if these are planted before the wounds are skinned over, it
occasions their rotting: the best time for transplanting and
parting of their roots is in July, soon after the stalks are decayed;
the soil should he a light sandy loam, mixed with a
fourth part of screened lime rubbish." <span class="smcap">Miller.</span></p>

<p>Authors have given to this plant the name of Scorpion Senna,
its seed-vessels, from their slender and jointed appearance, bearing
some resemblance to the tail of a scorpion.</p>

<p>It is a native of France and Germany, and a very old inhabitant
of our gardens, having been cultivated by <span class="smcap">Gerard</span>
in 1596; it is of low and slow growth: there is a shrub of it
in the Apothecaries Garden, Chelsea, which grew there in the
time of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, and which now is not more than five feet
high.</p>

<p>In the nurseries we have observed two varieties of it,
one in which the flowers have been tinged with bright red
inclining to orange and which is by far the most common, the
other with flowers wholly yellow, scarcely worth cultivating.</p>

<p>Its blossoms are produced in May and June, and sometimes
again in autumn; neatly trained to a wall or paling, it
makes a beautiful appearance when in flower, the shortness of
its shoots renders it a very proper object for this purpose.</p>

<p>Is propagated by seeds, layers, and cuttings; the first are
not produced in any great plenty with us.</p>

<p>The leaves by a proper fermentation are said to produce
a dye like that of Indigo.</p>

this plant as a Trifolium; afterwards the latter changed
it to <i>Psoralea</i>, and minutely described it in his <i>Mantissa</i>.</p>

the purple colour of the vexillum, contrasted with the white
of the alæ, gives to the flowers a very pleasing parti-coloured

<p>It is a most pleasing circumstance, when plants afford characters
by which they may with certainty be distinguished;
most of the Heaths are of this kind, and the present one in
particular: exclusive of its great peculiarity of growth, so obviously
expressed in our representation of it, its flowers diffuse
a strong honey-like fragrance, which, if other characters
were wanting, would at once discriminate it.</p>

<p>It is one of those Heaths which are enumerated in the
<i>Hort. Kew.</i> of Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, and was introduced to the royal
garden by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774; is now to be met with in
most of the collections of green-house plants about town, and
flowers in May and June.</p>

<p>Is usually propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>The <i>Mesembryanthemum micans</i>, so called from the glittering
particles which are conspicuous on its stalks and leaves, is a
species which has long been introduced to our gardens (having
been cultivated by Prof. <span class="smcap">Bradley</span> in 1716) for the beauty of
its flowers, which in richness of colour are indeed surpassed
by few; they are produced in the months of July and August,
but do not expand fully, unless the sun shines powerfully on
them; nor do they long retain that regular expansion observable
in some species, but quickly assume a somewhat ragged appearance;
nevertheless, upon the whole, it is one of those
species which is highly deserving of culture, by those who
are partial to this tribe of plants.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape, and readily propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>Varies with flowers of a paler hue.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Dillenia</i> was given by <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> to this genus
of plants, in honour of <span class="smcap">John James Dillenius</span>, Professor of
Botany at Oxford, and the celebrated author of the <i>Hist. Muscorum</i>,
<i>Hort. Elthamensis</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Until the publication of the first volume of the <i>Linnean Transactions</i>,
only one species of <i>Dillenia</i> was generally known; in
that work Prof. <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span> minutely describes five others,
three of which are there figured; all these, and one more described
by Dr. <span class="smcap">Roxburgh</span> in his work on the Coromandel
plants, are inserted by Prof. <span class="smcap">Martyn</span> in his new and highly
improved edition of <span class="smcap">Miller's</span> <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p>The present species, which now loses its name of <i>indica</i>
in that of <i>speciosa</i>, and which though not enumerated in the
<i>Hort. Kew.</i> has many years been cultivated at Kew, and in the
stoves of the curious near town, is a native of Malabar and
Java; in its native soil it becomes a vast tree, here we rarely
see it more than two or three feet high; its flowers are large
and shewy, but quickly deciduous, and remarkable for the unpleasantness
of their scent, which is like that of the <i>Lycium
japonicum</i>, but not being readily exhaled does not infect the
air of the stove.</p>

<p>This species is increased without difficulty by cuttings, which
quickly produce flowering plants.</p>

<p>Professors <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> and <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span> have both described
this rare bulbous plant, a native of the Cape, and newly introduced
to this country from Holland among a great variety
of others: it seems highly probable that the descriptions of
both these authors were taken from dried specimens, since they
accord so little with the living plant as it flowers with us.</p>

<p>At first sight, one would be led to regard this plant as an
<i>Antholyza</i> rather than a <i>Gladiolus</i>, its flowers bearing a great affinity
to those of the <i>Antholyza Meriana</i>, which differs widely
from those of the <i>Gladiolus communis</i>: Prof. <span class="smcap">Thunberg</span> having
thought fit to make a <i>Gladiolus</i> of that plant, he could do no
less than regard this as a <i>Gladiolus</i> also; we regret that the infinite
variety to which all the productions of nature are subject
should give occasion to versatile minds perpetually to
alter genera, often without due consideration. This species
flowers in February and March, requires the same treatment
as other Cape bulbs, and is propagated in the same manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Descr.</span> Stalk from twelve to eighteen inches high, upright,
smooth; Leaves about three or four, the lowermost a
sheath merely, the second leaf springs from a long sheath, is
puckered at its base, three inches in length, upright, rigid, flat,
linear-lanceolate, having three strong ribs, one in the middle,
two at the margin, which, projecting on each side, give to the
edge of the leaf a thick appearance, the leaves as they ascend,
gradually differ from this, and finally become hollow bracteæ,
which at first envelope the flowers, and afterwards contribute
to support them; Flowers from two to three, each standing on
a peduncle-like tube, enclosed by a bifid spatha, contained
within and about half the length of the bracteæ; Corolla bright
red, funnel-shaped, tube bent somewhat downwards, nearly
cylindrical, a little flattened, and glossy, limb divided into
six ovato-lanceolate segments, spreading outwards, the uppermost
segment incumbent, the three lowermost smaller than the
others; Filaments three, whitish, nearly straight; Antheræ
oblong, straight, purple; Style red; Stigma trifid, each segment
dividing into two villous lips.</p>

<p>"This vegetable is certainly one of the most beautiful productions
of <i>America</i>. It is but a weakly plant at first, and
supports itself for a time by the help of some neighbouring
shrub or tree; but it grows gradually more robust, and at
length acquires a pretty moderate stem, which divides into a
thousand weakly declining branches, well supplied with
beautiful rosy blossoms on all sides that give it a most
pleasing appearance in the season.</p>

<p>"It is chiefly found in cool, moist, and shady places, and
grows generally to the height of ten or fourteen feet; but
rises always higher when it remains a climber, in which state
it continues sometimes. It thrives best on the sides of
ponds or rivulets, and those that would choose to have it
flourish in their gardens, where it must naturally make a
very elegant appearance, ought to supply it with some support
while it continues young and weakly.</p>

<p>"It is called <i>Blakea</i>, after Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin Blake</span>, of Antigua,
a great promoter of every sort of useful knowledge,
and a gentleman to whose friendship the Natural History
of Jamaica chiefly owes its early appearance." <i>Brown's
Jamaic.</i></p>

<p>Our figure was drawn from a very fine healthy plant which
flowered in the collection of Lady <span class="smcap">Downe</span>, at her villa of
Bookham-Grove, near Leatherhead, in April 1799; though
not enumerated in the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>, it had produced blossoms
in several other collections near town long before this
period; those when they once expand are of short duration,
but the foliage when healthy is always handsome.</p>

<p>It is usually kept in the stove with other Jamaica plants,
and propagated by layers.</p>

<p>We cannot see the propriety of applying <i>foliis enerviis</i> to
the description of this species, since <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> himself, in his
<i>Sp. Pl.</i> describes the leaves as <i>trinervia</i>; three strong ribs
they always have, and usually two others near the margin
which are finer.</p>

<p>Such as are attached to the smaller alpine plants, will regard
this species of <i>Cardamine</i> as worthy a place in their collections;
one would scarcely have expected to find it in
<span class="smcap">Parkinson's</span> <i>Parad.</i> yet there it is described, and the following
account given of its introduction: "It was sent me by
my especial good friend <span class="smcap">John Tradescante</span>, who brought
it among other dainty plants from beyond the seas, and imparted
thereof a root to me."</p>

<p>This species is perennial, hardy, and of very humble
growth; the leaves grow thickly together, forming a kind of
tuft; the flowering stems rarely rise above the height of six
inches, and produce on their summits numerous flowers,
waved on their edges; all those which we have had an opportunity
of seeing have been perfectly white, <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> and
<span class="smcap">Haller</span> describe them as being sometimes tinged with red or
purple; they begin to appear towards the end of March and
continue through April, the shelter of a hand-glass open at
top is often necessary to protect and improve the flowering of
this and other such early-blowing plants.</p>

<p>It grows readily either in a pot or in the open border, succeeds
best when planted in bog earth in a situation moderately
moist and shady, and is readily increased by parting its roots,
which are somewhat of the creeping kind.</p>

<p>Grows spontaneously in most of the northern parts of
Europe, especially Lapland, Switzerland, and Austria.</p>

<p>The <i>Canna indica</i>, a native of both the Indies, is a plant
greatly admired for the beauty of its foliage and flowers, and
on that account generally cultivated; it has been called by
some <i>Indian Shot</i>, from the roundness and hardness of its
seeds.</p>

<p>We find it to have existed in our gardens in the time of
<span class="smcap">Gerard</span>, 1596. <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> was acquainted with that variety
of it which has yellow spotted flowers: Prof. <span class="smcap">Martyn</span>,
in his edition of <i>Miller's Dict.</i> has quoted the chief of what
these authors say of it, which as a matter of curiosity we shall
here transcribe: "<span class="smcap">Gerard</span> informs us, that in his time it
was in the garden at Padua, that he had planted it in his
garden divers times, but it never came to flowering; and
that it must be set or sown in a pot, with fine earth, or in
a bed made of horse-dung, in such manner as Cucumbers
and Musk-Melons are: <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> says, in some kindly
years this  beautiful plant has borne its brave flowers, but
never any ripe seed, and that it will not abide the extremities
of our winters, unless it meet with a stove, or hot-house,
such as are used in Germany; for neither house nor cellar
will preserve it: <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> saw it flowering by house-sides
in Spain and Portugal, and says, that the inhabitants there
use the seeds for making their rosaries."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> enumerates four varieties of it, viz. <i>rubra</i>,
<i>lutea</i>, <i>coccinea</i>, and <i>patens</i>.</p>

<p>"Being a native of the warmest parts of America, it requires
to be placed in a moderate stove in winter, where
they always flower in that season, at which time they
make a fine appearance, and in the summer place them
abroad in a sheltered situation with other tender exotic
plants, where they generally flower again, and produce ripe
seeds annually." <i>Mill. Dict.</i></p>

<p>"These plants will continue many years with proper management,
but as young plants always flower better than
the old root, so it is scarce worth while to continue them
after they have borne good seeds, which should be sown on
a hot-bed in the spring." <i>Mill. Dict.</i></p>

<p>Though the flowers of this Aloe have little to recommend
them, there is much to admire in the form and structure of
its leaves; and this pleasing circumstance attends it, it is perfectly
distinct from all the other species: when first introduced,
it was no doubt an object of great admiration; <span class="smcap">Fairchild</span>,
the celebrated Gardener of Hoxton, who preceded <span class="smcap">Miller</span>,
had it engraved, with several other succulents, on a plate
which is prefixed to Dr. <span class="smcap">Blair's</span> <i>Botanic Essays</i>, and which he
described to the Doctor, betwixt whom and Mr. <span class="smcap">Fairchild</span>
there appears to have subsisted a great degree of intimacy:
the Essays were printed in 1720.</p>

but not regularly so, increases very fast by offsets: Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>
makes it as he does all the Aloes indiscriminately, Dry Stove

peduncles about one-third of an inch long, usually supporting
one, sometimes two flowers; Calyx composed of five leaves
which are tinged with red and permanent; Corolla five petals,
white, ovato-lanceolate; Stamina filaments five, white, hairy,
at first upright, afterwards bending back betwixt the petals;
Antheræ before they open purple; Pollen yellow; Nectaries
of two kinds, five white, springing up between each filament,
and which may perhaps be considered as so many imperfect
stamina, they are broader, much smoother, and about one-third
of the length of the filaments, terminating in a transparent
gland instead of an anthera; five green, forming a kind of
calyx to the germen, from the top of which they spring, they
consist of five roundish, fleshy, spreading, green leaves, edged
with hairs; besides these, there is a glandular ring at the base
of the germen; Style white, tapering, very hairy; Stigma
simple; Flowers usually dropping off without ripening the
seeds.</p>

<p>"The Fan Aloe grows to the height of six or seven feet,
with a strong stem, towards the upper part of which are
produced two, three, or four heads, composed of long, compressed,
pliable leaves, of a sea-green colour, and ending
obtusely; these are placed in a double row, lying over each
other, with their edges the same way; the flowers are produced
in short loose spikes, are of a red colour, and appear
at different times of the year." <i>Mill. Dict.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> originally made this plant a variety of his <i>Aloe
disticha</i>, the leaves in their mode of growth are indeed truly
distichous, few plants afford a better example of such, but they
differ materially from those of the real <i>disticha</i> both in form
and colour: Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, with great propriety, made a
distinct species of it, by the name of <i>plicatilis</i>, or <i>Fan Aloe</i>,
which Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> has continued; and by the name of <i>Fan
Aloe</i> it is very generally known: we may remark, however,
that though this term may be justified by the form into which
the leaves expand, the <i>folium plicatile</i> of <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span> is a very
different kind of a leaf.</p>

<p>Both the foliage and flowers of this plant are very handsome,
in the course of many years it grows to a great size; in the
Chelsea Garden there are some fine plants of it, which grew
there in the time of <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, by whom it was cultivated in 1731.</p>

<p>It is native of Africa, requires the same treatment as the
other Aloes, and is propagated by dividing and planting its
heads.</p>

<p>It will be seen, on consulting the synonyms, that this native
of the Cape, though introduced to the Kew Garden by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Masson</span> in 1774, was long before known to a considerable
number of Botanists, and it is curious to see the different
opinions which they entertained of it; we abide by that of
Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, who has called it <i>Aristea</i>, from the bearded appearance,
we apprehend, of the Spathæ.</p>

<p>It is a small fibrous-rooted plant, rarely exceeding when
in bloom the height of six or eight inches, and would be too
insignificant for a green-house collection, were not its flowers
of a very brilliant blue colour; indeed <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, who appears
evidently to have cultivated it, says, the flowers make little
appearance, and so the plant is only kept for the sake of variety.
<i>Dict. 4to. ed. 6. Ixia africana.</i></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> tells us, that it flowers from April to June,
yet Mr. <span class="smcap">Andrews</span>, intent on giving to Messrs. <span class="smcap">Lee</span> and
<span class="smcap">Kennedy</span> the credit of flowering it first, disregards this information,
and is pleased to conjecture that the plant never
flowered at Kew, because Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, as he alleges, has not
given to it any specific character; not aware that, as a new
genus, its parts of fructification are described at the end of the
<i>Hort. Kew.</i> and that no specific character is ever given to a
plant, where there is only one of a genus, and that for the
most obvious reason.</p>

<p>The <i>Aristea</i> is a plant easily propagated by parting its roots,
as well as by seeds, will succeed in a small pot, and though a
green-house plant, will not be hurt by the moderate heat of
the stove, but flower the better for it.</p>

<p>The blossoms do not expand fully unless the sun shines hot
on them.</p>

<p>The plant whose elegant form is here so happily delineated
by the masterly pencil of Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>, according to Dr.
<span class="smcap">Ortega</span>, is an inhabitant of Mexico, where its seeds originally
were collected by Dr. <span class="smcap">Martin Sesse</span>, and sent to the
royal garden at Madrid, in which the plant produced flowers
and seeds in abundance; from thence seeds were obtained by
the Marchioness of <span class="smcap">Bute</span>, about the year 1786, who most
kindly communicated them to different persons in the neighbourhood
of London, and among others to my most generous
benefactor, <span class="smcap">James Vere</span>, Esq. in whose collection at his
villa, Kensington-Gore, by the careful management of his
Gardener, <span class="smcap">William Anderson</span>, it was first brought to
flower in this country, anno 1797.</p>

<p>Mons. <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span>, who resides at Madrid, where he seizes
every opportunity of publishing whatever new plants appear
there, has figured and described the present one, under the
name of <i>Usteria</i>, not aware that <span class="smcap">Wildenou</span> had previously
bestowed that name on a different plant; for this and other
reasons<a name="plate_FNanchor_6_6" id="plate_FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, Dr. <span class="smcap">Ortega</span>, in a new work of his above referred
to, has changed the term <i>Usteria</i> to that of <i>Maurandya</i>;
and, though we cannot cordially coincide with the Doctor in
the propriety either of his generic or trivial name, we have
adopted them.</p>

<p>This climber rises with a shrubby stalk to the height of
many feet, is very prolific in branches, and produces flowers
abundantly from July to September, which are succeeded by
ripe seed-vessels and seeds.&mdash;As the plant is easily propagated
by cuttings, as well as by seeds, it will soon become common
to our greenhouses, though it is rather better suited to the
conservatory; if its blossoms, which have a great affinity to
those of the Foxglove, had more colour in them, the plant
would be more desirable: at some future period such may
probably be obtained from seeds.</p>

<p>The Yellow Jasmine is often planted against walls, pales,
&amp;c. as the branches are weak and slender and it will grow
to be ten or twelve feet high if thus supported; it may however
be planted in shrubbery quarters, to which it is better
suited than the White Jasmine. The young shoots are of a
fine strong green colour, angular, and a little hairy. The
leaves are trifoliate, though sometimes they grow singly. They
are placed alternately on the branches, are of a thick consistence,
smooth, and of a fine deep green colour. These
leaves in well-sheltered places remain until the spring before
they fall off, so that this plant may not improperly be planted
among the Evergreens, especially as the young shoots are always
of a strong green. The flowers are yellow, and do not
possess the fragrance of the common Jasmine. They are produced
chiefly in June, and the blow is soon over. They are
succeeded by berries, which when ripe are black, whence
its name of Berry-bearing Jasmine. Although this shrub
possesses a certain stiffness, which gives it somewhat the appearance
of an artificial flower, yet the fine yellow colour of
its blossoms contrasts so well with the rich green of the foliage,
that in the flower-pot or bouquet it never fails to have a
conspicuous and pleasing effect.</p>

<p>Is a native of the South of Europe and the Levant, was

<p>The Pellitory of Spain is more celebrated as an useful than
an ornamental plant, the root which is of a very hot and
biting nature being a common application for the cure of the
tooth-ach; but, divested of its utility as a medicinal plant,
it merits a place in collections on account of the beauty
both of its foliage and flowers, the latter are more handsome
when in bud than when fully expanded, the underside
of the florets being of a fine purple colour, the upper
pure white; it is moreover a very rare plant in this
country, notwithstanding it was cultivated here so long since
as 1570: <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> evidently grew it, as he observes that
the roots of the cultivated plant, were much larger than those
of the wild one; he tells us also, that it was too tender to
endure our winters: to the latter cause, as well as to the
difficulty of propagating it, for it does not ripen its seeds in
this country, we may attribute its present scarcity: Mr.
<span class="smcap">Miller</span> raised this plant in 1732, in a very curious way,
from seeds picked out from among raisins.</p>

<p>In its place of growth it is not confined to Spain, but is
found in the Levant, Syria, Arabia, and elsewhere; flowers
with us from May to July, and may be increased by cuttings
of the roots, a mode of propagating by which we sometimes
happily succeed with rare and valuable plants when all others
fail.</p>

<p>It is a plant not very nice as to the quality of the soil in
which it grows, but must have a warm dry situation, will succeed
very well in a pot, or it may be planted in the open
border; but especial care must be taken to secure it against
frost in the winter.</p>

<p>Of this parasitical tribe the number of species described in
the third edition of the <i>Sp. Pl. Linn. 1764</i>, amounts to thirty;
in <span class="smcap">Gmelin's</span> thirteenth edition of the <i>Syst. Nat. Linn. 1791</i>,
no less than seventy-five are enumerated, which is a vast accession
in so short a period; most of these are natives of hot
climates, and on that account require a stove heat in this
country; from their nature also they require a situation not
to be exactly imitated, they are therefore to be regarded as
plants very difficult of culture, and we are not to be surprised
that three species only are enumerated in the <i>Hort. Kew.</i>&mdash;but,
since the publication of that work, many others have been
added to the royal collection, and this among the rest.</p>

<p>The rare and singular species here represented, a native of
the warmer parts of America, and the West-Indies, flowered
with Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitley</span>, Nurseryman, Old-Brompton, in Feb.
1799, and at irregular periods before that time; he informs
me that it is not constant as to the time of its blowing, and
that though the plant flowers with him, it never assumes a fine
healthy green appearance, he propagates it by dividing its
limbs or branches, which often put forth small roots; the
plant grows in a pot, in a mixture of loam and peat or bog-earth,
and is kept constantly plunged in the tan-pit of the
stove.</p>

<p>In a former Number of this Work, we gave a figure of the
large variety of <i>Sisyrinch. Bermud.</i> of <i>Linn.</i> regarding it as
a distinct species, and naming it <i>iridioides</i>, conformably to
<span class="smcap">Dillenius's</span> specific description; we regret now that we did
not continue to it the name of <i>Bermudiana</i> (it being the true
Bermudas plant) and which cannot with propriety be applied
to the present species, a native of Virginia, far more diminutive,
with flowers much smaller, of a paler blue colour, a
much hardier plant also, and of more ready growth; it is indeed
a truly hardy perennial, adapted to the open border, in
which it will grow readily, and produce abundance of flowering
stems in June and July; the flowers expand to the sun,
and are followed by numerous seed-vessels which ripen their
seeds, by which the plant may be increased, or by parting its
roots in the autumn. Its stalk affords an excellent example
of the <i>caulis anceps</i>. We readily embrace the opportunity here
afforded us of correcting an error in regard to the hardiness of
the <i>Sisyrinch. iridioides</i>, which we were led into partly by <span class="smcap">Miller's</span>
account, and partly from observing the plant to survive a
mild winter in the open ground; we have since found that it is a

its name; its flowers, produced on long racemi springing from
the sides of the stem or branches, are of a singular dull red
colour, and rarely followed by seeds with us.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape<a name="plate_FNanchor_8_8" id="plate_FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#plate_Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>, from whence it was introduced
by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774; flowers from June to October,
and is usually increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>There is a description of this species in the <i>Mantiss. Pl.
Linn.</i> but we know of no figure of it that has yet been
published.</p>

<p>The learned and instructive <span class="smcap">Kæmpfer</span> in his <i>Amæn. Exot.</i>
that vast fund of most useful information, gives a figure of this
plant, in which it is represented both with flowers and seed-vessels,
accompanied with a description and short account of
it; from which we learn that it is cultivated in Japan as an
ornamental plant, that the flowers are produced in February,
before the leaves, that they have the scent of the violet, but
become unpleasant on being long smelt to.</p>

<p>Hearing that Lord <span class="smcap">Coventry</span> was the first who possessed
this plant in England, I took the liberty of writing to his Lordship
in January 1799, to request some information on this
point, as well as some others relative to its culture, &amp;c. On
the 13th of the same month, his Lordship had the goodness
to send me a beautiful specimen of the plant in bloom, a
seedling plant one year old, together with a seed-vessel of the
year 1798, and some seeds; in the Earl's letter is the following
passage:&mdash;"the beauty of the <i>Calycanthus præcox</i> at this
moment surpasses all description, it is covered with blossoms
from top to bottom, and the fragrance of it may be perceived
at the distance of fifty yards from the conservatory."</p>

<p>By his Lordship's direction, I received at the same time
from his Gardener, Mr. <span class="smcap">William Dean</span>, the following information,
in answer to my queries:&mdash;"My Lord received the
plant from China in 1766:&mdash;it was planted in a conservatory,
is now sixteen feet high, and expands ten feet wide:&mdash;bears
a succession of flowers from September to March:&mdash;the time
of its first blowing I cannot precisely ascertain, but believe it
to be nearly twenty years back:&mdash;it is propagated by layers,
cuttings, and seeds, the latter it produces most years at
Croome, but I believe at no other place in England:&mdash;there
are plants of it at Croome six feet high, in a warm situation
in the open border, which have stood out several years by
being covered with a single mat in severe weather."</p>

<p>Not expecting to receive a plant from Lord <span class="smcap">Coventry</span> in
bloom, our drawing was made from one which flowered with
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitley</span>, Nurseryman, Old-Brompton, December 22,
1798, and which came originally from Croome, his Lordship
having presented most of the Nurserymen about town with
plants of it; the blossoms of that from Croome were somewhat
larger than those here represented, and the petals were
less striped, indeed almost wholly tinged with purple, the
leaves also proceeded more from the summit of the stalks and
were of a much greener hue, owing no doubt to its being
kept in the conservatory, while Mr. <span class="smcap">Whitley's</span> plant was
tacked to the outside of the bottom of the greenhouse.</p>

<p>In the number of its stamina, which is rarely more
than five, it does not accord with the character of the class
icosandria, nor do the seeds agree with the generic character
as described by <span class="smcap">Linnæus</span>.</p>

<p>This elegant species of <i>Dracocephalum</i>, a native of Virginia,
and other parts of North-America, is a hardy herbaceous
plant, rising to the height of about two feet, and producing
numerous flowers in long spikes, usually arranged on each
side of the stalk.</p>

<p>It comes near to the <i>denticulatum</i> already figured, but differs
in its superior height, the form of its leaves, the number
of its flowers, and many other particulars.</p>

<p>It flowers from July to September, and with me has generally
ripened much of its seed, from which it may be easily
raised, as also by parting of its roots in spring or autumn; it
succeeds best in a moist situation, and its stalks require to be
carefully and timely sticked.</p>

<p>Was cultivated as long since as 1683, by Mr. <span class="smcap">James Sutherland</span>.</p>

<p>Of this genus we have already figured six different species;
this is another newly discovered one, which, like most of its
kind, displays its beauties chiefly in the night. It is the only
one, as far as we yet know, that has white blossoms; these,
when first expanded, are beautifully so, but in the morning they
change to a purple colour, fade, and their place is supplied by
a fresh succession. In this remarkable change of colour, it
bears some affinity to the <i>Œnothera anomala</i>, which may be
considered as strengthening our opinion that the latter plant
belongs to this genus rather than to that of <i>Gaura</i>. The
<i>Œnothera tetraptera</i> is a native of Mexico, its duration as
yet not certainly ascertained, but may be treated as a tender
annual; and such plants as do not flower the first year, may
be preserved under glasses through the winter. It was raised
from seeds sent by Mr. <span class="smcap">Donn</span>, from Cambridge; but was probably
first introduced into this country from seeds sent to the
Marchioness of <span class="smcap">Bute</span>, by Prof. <span class="smcap">Ortega</span>, of Madrid.</p>
